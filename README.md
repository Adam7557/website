### What is Charles T. King?
Charles T. King is an organization located in Millburn, New Jersey that gives interest-free student loans to local high school students. It was named after a former superintendent of the Millburn Public School District. Because Charles T. King does not have a website yet, we are making one for them. This is the repository for said website.

Directions for Editing the Code
-------------------------------
We use the [Fork and Pull Model](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). I know what you're thinking- let me explain. First, let's look at the simplest possible method: the Shared Repository model.

### Shared Repository
In this model, everyone makes a change on their local machine and then pushes the changes to a single repository. This model has several benefits:
* Faster because it just has 1 repository
* Easier to keep track of 1 repository if there are only a few people making changes

However, it is not good to push directly to the central repository because:
* It might conflict with someone else's change, resulting in a merge conflict
* The changes aren't looked over by others, so it might break something or be bad
* It requires that you have push access to the repository
	* This point is mostly moot for us because everyone has push access, but it's good to know anyway.
That is why we are using the Fork and Pull model.

### Fork and Pull model
The [Charles T. King' repository](https://github.com/Charles-T-King/website) is the central repository, meaning that everyone makes changes ultimately to it. However, we don't push directly to the central repository. Let's look at an example situation in which Luke has to fix something in the code:
1. Luke forks the central repository
2. Luke makes changes to his fork
3. Luke then makes a pull request
	a. If everyone likes it, then they can accept the request and pull the changes to the central repo
	b. If they don't like it, Luke improves his fork and then makes another request.

Now, let's see how to do this on the GitHub website.
#### How to Fork a Repository
1. Open the repository
2. Click the Fork button on the top-right
3. Select your own account because you are forking a version for yourself
You now have a forked repository. You can safely make changes to it without affecting the central repository.

After you have made changes to your forked repository, make a pull request.
#### How to Make a Pull Request
1. Open the 'Pull requests' tab on the GitHub sidebar
2. Click 'New pull request'
3. By default, you should make the pull request to the same branch that you forked from
4. Add a description to your pull request
5. Submit the pull request and hope that everyone likes it

Now, lets see how to accept the pull request if they end up liking it.
#### How to Accept a Pull Request
1. Open the 'Pull request' tab on the central repository
2. Open the appropriate pull request
3. The 'Files changed' tab on the top of the pull request shows what changes have been made, so look at that
4. If you like the changes, go to the Conversation tab and click the 'Merge pull request' at the bottom of the thread
5. If you don't like the changes, comment what you don't like about it.
6. After you are done with a pull request, make sure to close the pull request

### How to setup cloud9 with this project
1. Fork the repository
2. Open [your Dashboard](https://c9.io/dashboard.html) on Cloud9
3. On the left sidebar, click on the 'website' project from the 'Projects on GitHub' tab
4. Select PHP as the project type
5. Wait for Cloud9 to set up the workspace
You now have a local copy of your fork on which you can make changes.
Before you run the server, you have to set up the backend. The c9-setup.sh script does this for you. Just run:
```shell
sudo bash c9-setup.sh
```

### How to Update your Fork
Open the workspace folder of your fork and run this command:

``` shell
bash fork-update.sh develop
```

Make sure that the fork-update.sh is the latest version. It will update itself
